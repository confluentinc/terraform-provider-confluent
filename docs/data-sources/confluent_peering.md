data "confluent_peering" "example_using_id" {
  id = "peer-abc123"
  environment {
    id = "env-xyz456"
  }
}
output "example_using_id" {
  value = data.confluent_peering.example_using_id
}
data "confluent_peering" "example_using_name" {
  display_name = "my_peering"
  environment {

Defaults to `false`. Learn more about considerations / limitations of the Import Custom Routes option [here](https://docs.confluent.io/cloud/current/networking/peering/gcp-peering.html#import-custom-routes).

-> **Note:** Use the `aws[0]`, `azure[0]`, or `gcp[0]` prefix for referencing these attributes, for example, `data.confluent_peering.example_using_name.aws[0].account`.
