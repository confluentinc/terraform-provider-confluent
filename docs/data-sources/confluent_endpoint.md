# confluent_endpoint Data Source

[![General Availability](https://img.shields.io/badge/Lifecycle%20Stage-General%20Availability-%2345c6e8)](https://docs.confluent.io/cloud/current/api.html#section/Versioning/API-Lifecycle-Policy)

`confluent_endpoint` describes an Endpoint data source.

An Endpoint object represents a Fully Qualified Domain Name (FQDN) for a Confluent service resource via a specific networking solution for a given Confluent Cloud environment. This API provides a list of Confluent Cloud endpoints filtered by service, cloud provider, region, etc.

## Example Usage

```terraform
provider "confluent" {
  cloud_api_key    = var.confluent_cloud_api_key    # optionally use CONFLUENT_CLOUD_API_KEY env var
  cloud_api_secret = var.confluent_cloud_api_secret # optionally use CONFLUENT_CLOUD_API_SECRET env var
}

data "confluent_endpoint" "main" {
  filter {
    environment {
      id = "env-123abc"
    }
    service = "KAFKA"
    resource = "lkc-abc123"
    cloud = "AWS"
    region = "us-west-2"
  }
}

output "endpoints" {
  value = data.confluent_endpoint.main.endpoints
}
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

- `filter` (Required Configuration Block) supports the following:
    - `environment` (Required Configuration Block) supports the following:
        - `id` - (Required String) The ID of the Environment that the Endpoint belongs to, for example, `env-123abc`.
    - `service` - (Required String) The Confluent Cloud service. Accepted values are: `KAFKA`, `SCHEMA_REGISTRY`, `FLINK`.
    - `resource` - (Optional String) The resource associated with the endpoint. The resource can be one of Kafka Cluster ID (example: `lkc-12345`), or Schema Registry Cluster ID (example: `lsrc-12345`). May be omitted if not associated with a resource.
    - `gateway` (Optional Configuration Block) supports the following:
        - `id` - (Optional String) The ID of the gateway to which the Endpoint belongs, for example, `gw-abc123`.
    - `access_point` (Optional Configuration Block) supports the following:
        - `id` - (Optional String) The ID of the access point to which the Endpoint belongs, for example, `ap-abc123`.
    - `cloud` - (Optional String) The cloud service provider. Accepted values are: `AWS`, `GCP`, `AZURE`.
    - `region` - (Optional String) The cloud service provider region in which the resource is located, for example, `us-west-2`.
    - `is_private` - (Optional Boolean) Whether the endpoint is private (true) or public (false).

## Attributes Reference

In addition to the preceding arguments, the following attributes are exported:

- `endpoints` - (Computed List) List of endpoints matching the filter criteria. Each endpoint object contains:
    - `id` - (Computed String) The ID of the Endpoint.
    - `api_version` - (Computed String) API Version defines the schema version of this representation of an Endpoint.
    - `kind` - (Computed String) Kind defines the object this Endpoint represents.
    - `cloud` - (Computed String) The cloud service provider.
    - `region` - (Computed String) The cloud service provider region in which the resource is located.
    - `service` - (Computed String) The Confluent Cloud service.
    - `is_private` - (Computed Boolean) Whether the endpoint is private (true) or public (false).
    - `connection_type` - (Computed String) The network connection type. Accepted values are: `PUBLIC`, `PRIVATE_LINK`, `PEERING`, `TRANSIT_GATEWAY`, `PRIVATE_NETWORK_INTERFACE`.
    - `endpoint` - (Computed String) The endpoint URL or address, for example, `https://lkc-abc123-ap12345.us-west-2.aws.accesspoint.glb.confluent.cloud:443`.
    - `endpoint_type` - (Computed String) The endpoint type enum values:
        - `REST` - REST API endpoint for HTTP/HTTPS access, used by Kafka/Flink/Schema Registry services.
        - `BOOTSTRAP` - Kafka native protocol bootstrap servers for direct client connections, used by Kafka only.
        - `LANGUAGE_SERVICE` - Flink language service endpoint for SQL/Table API, used by Flink only.
    - `environment` (Computed Configuration Block) supports the following:
        - `id` - (Computed String) The ID of the Environment that the Endpoint belongs to.
    - `resource` (Computed Configuration Block) supports the following:
        - `id` - (Computed String) The ID of the resource associated with the endpoint (e.g., Kafka Cluster ID or Schema Registry Cluster ID).
        - `kind` - (Computed String) The kind of the resource.
    - `gateway` (Computed Configuration Block) supports the following:
        - `id` - (Computed String) The ID of the gateway to which the Endpoint belongs.
    - `access_point` (Computed Configuration Block) supports the following:
        - `id` - (Computed String) The ID of the access point to which the Endpoint belongs.
