You can import a DNS Forwarder by using Environment ID and DNS Forwarder ID, in the format `<Environment ID>/<DNS Forwarder ID>`. The following example shows how to import a DNS Forwarder:

```shell
$ export CONFLUENT_CLOUD_API_KEY="<cloud_api_key>"
$ export CONFLUENT_CLOUD_API_SECRET="<cloud_api_secret>"
$ terraform import confluent_dns_forwarder.main env-abc123/dnsf-abc123
```
