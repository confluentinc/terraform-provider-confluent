# confluent_dns_forwarder Resource

[![General Availability](https://img.shields.io/badge/Lifecycle%20Stage-General%20Availability-%2345c6e8)](https://docs.confluent.io/cloud/current/api.html#section/Versioning/API-Lifecycle-Policy)

`confluent_dns_forwarder` provides a DNS Forwarder resource that enables creating, editing, and deleting DNS Forwarders on Confluent Cloud.

## Example Usage

### Option #1: Create using ForwardViaIp method

```terraform
resource "confluent_environment" "development" {
  display_name = "Development"
}

resource "confluent_dns_forwarder" "main" {
  display_name = "dns_forwarder"
  environment {
    id = confluent_environment.development.id
  }
  domains = ["example.com", "domainname.com"]
  gateway {
    id = confluent_network.main.gateway[0].id
  }
  forward_via_ip {
    dns_server_ips = ["10.200.0.0", "10.200.0.1"]
  }
}
```

### Option #2: Create using ForwardViaGcpDnsZones method

```terraform
resource "confluent_environment" "development" {
  display_name = "Development"
}

resource "confluent_dns_forwarder" "main" {
  display_name = "dns_forwarder"
  environment {
    id = confluent_environment.development.id
  }
  domains = ["example.com", "domainname.com"]
  gateway {
    id = confluent_network.main.gateway[0].id
  }
  forward_via_gcp_zones {
    domain_mappings = {
        "example.com" = "zone-1,project-1"
    }
  }
}
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

- `display_name` - (Optional String) The name of the DNS Forwarder.
- `environment` (Required Configuration Block) supports the following:
  - `id` - (Required String) The ID of the Environment that the DNS Forwarder belongs to, for example, `env-abc123`.
- `gateway` (Required Configuration Block) supports the following:
  - `id` - (Required String) The ID of the gateway to which the DNS Forwarder belongs, for example, `gw-abc123`.
- `domains` (Required String List) List of domains for the DNS forwarder to use.
- `forward_via_ip` (Optional Configuration Block) supports the following:
  - `dns_server_ips` (Required String List) List of IP addresses of the DNS server.
- `forward_via_gcp_zones` (Optional Configuration Block) supports the following:
  - `domain_mappings` (Required Map List) List of Maps which contains the domain to zone and project mapping.
  
-> **Note:** The `forward_via_gcp_zones` and `forward_via_ip` blocks are mutually exclusive, and one of them must be provided.

-> **Note:** The zone and project must be specified in the correct order, separated by a comma, to ensure accurate `domain_mappings`.

## Attributes Reference

In addition to the preceding arguments, the following attributes are exported:

- `id` - (Required String) The ID of the DNS Forwarder, for example, `dnsf-abc123`.

## Import

-> **Note:** `CONFLUENT_CLOUD_API_KEY` and `CONFLUENT_CLOUD_API_SECRET` environment variables must be set before importing a DNS Forwarder.

You can import a DNS Forwarder by using Environment ID and DNS Forwarder ID, in the format `<Environment ID>/<DNS Forwarder ID>`. The following example shows how to import a DNS Forwarder:

```shell
$ export CONFLUENT_CLOUD_API_KEY="<cloud_api_key>"
$ export CONFLUENT_CLOUD_API_SECRET="<cloud_api_secret>"
$ terraform import confluent_dns_forwarder.main env-abc123/dnsf-abc123
```
