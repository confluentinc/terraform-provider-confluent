# confluent_transit_gateway_attachment Resource

[![General Availability](https://img.shields.io/badge/Lifecycle%20Stage-General%20Availability-%2345c6e8)](https://docs.confluent.io/cloud/current/api.html#section/Versioning/API-Lifecycle-Policy)

`confluent_transit_gateway_attachment` provides a Transit Gateway Attachment resource that enables creating, editing, and deleting Transit Gateway Attachments on Confluent Cloud.

-> **Note:** It is recommended to set `lifecycle { prevent_destroy = true }` on production instances to prevent accidental Transit Gateway Attachment deletion. This setting rejects plans that would destroy or recreate the Transit Gateway Attachment, such as attempting to change uneditable attributes. Read more about it in the [Terraform docs](https://www.terraform.io/language/meta-arguments/lifecycle#prevent_destroy).

## Example Usage

### Example Transit Gateway Attachment on AWS

```terraform
resource "confluent_environment" "development" {
  display_name = "Development"
}

resource "confluent_network" "aws-transit-gateway-attachment" {
  display_name     = "AWS Transit Gateway Attachment Network"
  cloud            = "AWS"
  region           = "us-east-2"
  cidr             = "10.10.0.0/16"
  connection_types = ["TRANSITGATEWAY"]
  environment {
    id = confluent_environment.development.id
  }

  lifecycle {
    prevent_destroy = true
  }
}

resource "confluent_transit_gateway_attachment" "aws" {
  display_name = "AWS Transit Gateway Attachment"
  aws {
    ram_resource_share_arn = "arn:aws:ram:us-east-2:000000000000:resource-share/xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxx"
    transit_gateway_id     = "tgw-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx"
    routes                 = ["192.168.0.0/16", "172.16.0.0/12", "100.64.0.0/10", "10.0.0.0/8"]
  }
  environment {
    id = confluent_environment.development.id
  }
  network {
    id = confluent_network.aws-transit-gateway-attachment.id
  }

  lifecycle {
    prevent_destroy = true
  }
}
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

- `display_name` - (Optional String) The name of the Transit Gateway Attachment.
- `environment` (Required Configuration Block) supports the following:
    - `id` - (Required String) The ID of the Environment that the Transit Gateway Attachment belongs to, for example, `env-abc123`.
- `network` (Required Configuration Block) supports the following:
    - `id` - (Required String) The ID of the Network that the Transit Gateway Attachment belongs to, for example, `n-abc123`.
- `aws` - (Required Configuration Block) The AWS-specific Transit Gateway Attachment details. It supports the following:
    - `ram_resource_share_arn` - (Required String) The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the Resource Access Manager (RAM) Resource Share of the transit gateway your Confluent Cloud network attaches to.
    - `transit_gateway_id` - (Required String) The ID of the AWS Transit Gateway that you want Confluent CLoud to be attached to. Must start with `tgw-`.
    - `routes` - (Required List of String) List of destination routes for traffic from Confluent VPC to customer VPC via Transit Gateway.

-> **Note:** Learn more about Transit Gateway Attachment limitations on AWS [here](https://docs.confluent.io/cloud/current/networking/aws-transit-gateway.html#limitations).

## Attributes Reference

In addition to the preceding arguments, the following attributes are exported:

- `id` - (Required String) The ID of the Transit Gateway Attachment, for example, `tgwa-abc123`.
- `aws` - (Required Configuration Block) The AWS-specific Transit Gateway Attachment details. It supports the following:
    - `transit_gateway_attachment_id` - (Required String) The ID of the AWS Transit Gateway VPC Attachment that attaches Confluent VPC to Transit Gateway.

## Import

-> **Note:** `CONFLUENT_CLOUD_API_KEY` and `CONFLUENT_CLOUD_API_SECRET` environment variables must be set before importing a Transit Gateway Attachment.

You can import a Transit Gateway Attachment by using Environment ID and Transit Gateway Attachment ID, in the format `<Environment ID>/<Transit Gateway Attachment ID>`. The following example shows how to import a Transit Gateway Attachment:

```shell
$ export CONFLUENT_CLOUD_API_KEY="<cloud_api_key>"
$ export CONFLUENT_CLOUD_API_SECRET="<cloud_api_secret>"
$ terraform import confluent_transit_gateway_attachment.my_tgwa env-abc123/tgwa-abc123
```

!> **Warning:** Do not forget to delete terminal command history afterwards for security purposes.
