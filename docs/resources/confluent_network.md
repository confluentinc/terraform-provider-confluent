# confluent_network Resource

[![General Availability](https://img.shields.io/badge/Lifecycle%20Stage-General%20Availability-%2345c6e8)](https://docs.confluent.io/cloud/current/api.html#section/Versioning/API-Lifecycle-Policy)

`confluent_network` provides a Network resource that enables creating, editing, and deleting Networks on Confluent Cloud.

-> **Note:** It is recommended to set `lifecycle { prevent_destroy = true }` on production instances to prevent accidental network deletion. This setting rejects plans that would destroy or recreate the network, such as attempting to change uneditable attributes. Read more about it in the [Terraform docs](https://www.terraform.io/language/meta-arguments/lifecycle#prevent_destroy).

## Example Usage

### Example Network that supports Private Link Connections
```terraform
resource "confluent_environment" "development" {
  display_name = "Development"
}

resource "confluent_network" "aws-private-link" {
  display_name     = "AWS Private Link Network"
  cloud            = "AWS"
  region           = "us-east-1"
  connection_types = ["PRIVATELINK"]
  zones            = ["use1-az1", "use1-az2", "use1-az6"]
  environment {
    id = confluent_environment.development.id
  }
}
```

### Example Network that supports Peering Connections
```terraform
resource "confluent_environment" "development" {
  display_name = "Development"

  lifecycle {
    prevent_destroy = true
  }
}

resource "confluent_network" "azure-peering" {
  display_name     = "Azure Peering Network"
  cloud            = "AZURE"
  region           = "eastus2"
  cidr             = "10.10.0.0/16"
  connection_types = ["PEERING"]
  environment {
    id = confluent_environment.development.id
  }

  lifecycle {
    prevent_destroy = true
  }
}
```

  connection_types = ["PRIVATELINK"]
  zones            = ["us-central1-a", "us-central1-b", "us-central1-c"]
  environment {
    id = confluent_environment.development.id
  }

  lifecycle {
    prevent_destroy = true
  }
}
```

### Example Network that supports Transit Gateway Endpoints
```terraform
resource "confluent_environment" "development" {
  display_name = "Development"

  lifecycle {
    prevent_destroy = true
  }
}

resource "confluent_network" "aws-transit-gateway-attachment" {
  display_name     = "AWS Transit Gateway Attachment Network"
  cloud            = "AWS"
  region           = "us-east-1"
  cidr             = "10.10.0.0/16"
  connection_types = ["TRANSITGATEWAY"]
  environment {
    id = confluent_environment.development.id
  }

  lifecycle {
    prevent_destroy = true
  }
}
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

- `display_name` - (Required String) The name of the Network.
- `cloud` - (Required String) The cloud service provider in which the network exists. Accepted values are: `AWS`, `AZURE`, and `GCP`.
- `region` - (Required String) The cloud provider region where the network exists.
- `cidr` - (Optional String) The IPv4 CIDR block to be used for the network. Must be `/16`. Required for VPC peering and AWS TransitGateway.
- `reserved_cidr` - (Optional String) The reserved IPv4 CIDR block to be used for the network. Must be `/24`. If not specified, Confluent Cloud Network uses `172.20.255.0/24`.
- `zone_info` (Optional Configuration Blocks) Each item represents information related to a single zone. It supports the following:
  - `zone_id` - (Required String) Cloud provider zone ID.
  - `cidr` - (Required String) The IPv4 CIDR block to be used for the network. Must be `/27`. Required for VPC peering and AWS TransitGateway.

-> **Note:** The `reserved_cidr` attribute and `zone_info` blocks are in [Early Access lifecycle stage](https://docs.confluent.io/cloud/current/api.html#section/Versioning/API-Lifecycle-Policy) for AWS networks with `PRIVATELINK` connection type. It is in an [Early Access lifecycle stage](https://docs.confluent.io/cloud/current/api.html#section/Versioning/API-Lifecycle-Policy) for GCP and Azure networks with `PRIVATELINK` connection type.

- `connection_types` - (Required List of String) The list of connection types that may be used with the network. Accepted connection types are: `PEERING`, `TRANSITGATEWAY`, and `PRIVATELINK`.
- `zones` - (Optional List of String) The 3 availability zones for this network. They can optionally be specified for AWS networks
  used with PrivateLink, for GCP networks used with Private Service Connect, and for AWS and GCP
  networks used with Peering. Otherwise, they are automatically chosen by Confluent Cloud.
  On AWS, zones are AWS [AZ IDs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ram/latest/userguide/working-with-az-ids.html), for example, `use1-az3`.
  On GCP, zones are GCP [zones](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/regions-zones), for example, `us-central1-c`.
  On Azure, zones are Confluent-chosen names (for example, `1`, `2`, `3`) since Azure does not have universal zone identifiers.
- `dns_config` (Optional Configuration Block) Network DNS config. It applies only to the PRIVATELINK network connection type. It supports the following:
  - `resolution` - (Required String) Network DNS resolution.
    When resolution is `CHASED_PRIVATE`, clusters in this network require both public and private DNS to resolve cluster endpoints.
    When resolution is `PRIVATE`, clusters in this network only require private DNS to resolve cluster endpoints.

-> **Note:** The value `PRIVATE` is in [Generally Available lifecycle stage](https://docs.confluent.io/cloud/current/api.html#section/Versioning/API-Lifecycle-Policy) for AWS networks with `PRIVATELINK` connection type. It is in an [Early Access lifecycle stage](https://docs.confluent.io/cloud/current/api.html#section/Versioning/API-Lifecycle-Policy) for GCP and Azure networks with `PRIVATELINK` connection type.

- `environment` (Required Configuration Block) supports the following:
  - `id` - (Required String) The ID of the Environment that the Network belongs to, for example, `env-abc123`.

-> **Note:** Use `aws[0]`, `azure[0]`, or `gcp[0]` prefix for referencing these attributes, for example, `confluent_network.private-link.azure[0].private_link_service_aliases`.

## Import

-> **Note:** `CONFLUENT_CLOUD_API_KEY` and `CONFLUENT_CLOUD_API_SECRET` environment variables must be set before importing a Network.

You can import a Network by using Environment ID and Network ID, in the format `<Environment ID>/<Network ID>`. The following example shows how to import a Network:

```shell
$ export CONFLUENT_CLOUD_API_KEY="<cloud_api_key>"
$ export CONFLUENT_CLOUD_API_SECRET="<cloud_api_secret>"
$ terraform import confluent_network.my_network env-abc123/n-abc123
```

!> **Warning:** Do not forget to delete terminal command history afterwards for security purposes.
