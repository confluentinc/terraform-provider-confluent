# confluent_ip_filter Resource

[![General Availability](https://img.shields.io/badge/Lifecycle%20Stage-General%20Availability-%2345c6e8)](https://docs.confluent.io/cloud/current/api.html#section/Versioning/API-Lifecycle-Policy)

`confluent_ip_filter` provides an IP Filter resource that enables creating, editing, and deleting IP Filters on Confluent Cloud.

-> **Note:** See [IP Filtering on Confluent Cloud](https://docs.confluent.io/cloud/current/security/access-control/ip-filtering/overview.html) for more details about the IP Filtering feature and its limitations.

## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "confluent_ip_filter" "management-filter" {
  filter_name    = "Management API Rules"
  resource_group = "management"
  ip_groups      = [ confluent_ip_group.example.id ]
}

resource "confluent_ip_filter" "multiple-filter" {
  filter_name      = "Management, Schema, Flink API Rules"
  resource_group   = "multiple"
  operation_groups = [
    "MANAGEMENT",
    "SCHEMA",
    "FLINK"
  ]
  ip_groups = [confluent_ip_group.group.id]
}
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

- `filter_name` - (Required String) A human-readable name for an IP Filter. Can contain any unicode letter or number, the ASCII space character, or any of the following special characters: `[`, `]`, `|`, `&`, `+`, `-`, `_`, `/`, `.`, `,`.
- `resource_group` - (Required String) Scope of resources covered by this IP Filter. Available resource groups include `"management"` and `"multiple"`.
- `resource_scope` - (Optional String) A CRN that specifies the scope of the IP Filter, specifically the organization or environment. Without specifying this property, the IP Filter would apply to the whole organization. For example, `"crn://confluent.cloud/organization=1111aaaa-11aa-11aa-11aa-111111aaaaaa"` or `data.confluent_organization.resource_name`.
- `operation_groups` - (Optional List of Strings) Scope of resources covered by this IP Filter. Resource group must be set to 'multiple' in order to use this property. During update operations, note that the operation groups passed in will replace the list of existing operation groups (passing in an empty list will remove all operation groups) from the filter (in line with the behavior for `ip_groups` attribute).
- `ip_groups` - (Required List of Strings) A list of IP Groups.

## Attributes Reference

In addition to the preceding arguments, the following attributes are exported:

- `id` - (Required String) The ID of the IP Filter (e.g., `ipf-abc123`).

## Import

-> **Note:** `CONFLUENT_CLOUD_API_KEY` and `CONFLUENT_CLOUD_API_SECRET` environment variables must be set before importing an IP Filter.

You can import an IP Filter by using IP Filter ID, for example:

```shell
$ export CONFLUENT_CLOUD_API_KEY="<cloud_api_key>"
$ export CONFLUENT_CLOUD_API_SECRET="<cloud_api_secret>"
$ terraform import confluent_ip_filter.example ipf-abc123
```

!> **Warning:** Do not forget to delete terminal command history afterwards for security purposes.
