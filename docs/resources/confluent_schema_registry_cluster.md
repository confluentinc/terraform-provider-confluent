# confluent_schema_registry_cluster Resource

[![Deprecated](https://img.shields.io/badge/Lifecycle%20Stage-Deprecated-yellow)](https://docs.confluent.io/cloud/current/api.html#section/Versioning/API-Lifecycle-Policy)

`confluent_schema_registry_cluster` provides a Schema Registry cluster resource that enables creating, editing, and deleting Schema Registry clusters on Confluent Cloud.

!> **Warning:** The `confluent_schema_registry_cluster` resource has been deprecated and will be removed in the next major version of the provider (2.0.0).
Refer to the [Upgrade Guide](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/confluentinc/confluent/latest/docs/guides/version-2-upgrade) for more details.
The guide will be published once version 2.0.0 is released.

-> **Note:** It is recommended to set `lifecycle { prevent_destroy = true }` on production instances to prevent accidental cluster deletion. This setting rejects plans that would destroy or recreate the cluster, such as attempting to change uneditable attributes. Read more about it in the [Terraform docs](https://www.terraform.io/language/meta-arguments/lifecycle#prevent_destroy).

## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "confluent_environment" "development" {
  display_name = "Development"

  lifecycle {
    prevent_destroy = true
  }
}

data "confluent_schema_registry_region" "example" {
  cloud   = "AWS"
  region  = "us-east-2"
  package = "ESSENTIALS"
}

resource "confluent_schema_registry_cluster" "essentials" {
  package = data.confluent_schema_registry_region.example.package

  environment {
    id = confluent_environment.development.id
  }

  region {
    # See https://docs.confluent.io/cloud/current/stream-governance/packages.html#stream-governance-regions
    # Schema Registry and Kafka clusters can be in different regions as well as different cloud providers,
    # but you should to place both in the same cloud and region to restrict the fault isolation boundary.
    id = data.confluent_schema_registry_region.example.id
  }

  lifecycle {
    prevent_destroy = true
  }
}
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

- `package` - (Required String) The type of the billing package. Accepted values are: `ESSENTIALS` and `ADVANCED`.
- `environment` (Required Configuration Block) supports the following:
    - `id` - (Required String) The ID of the Environment that the Schema Registry cluster belongs to, for example, `env-abc123`.
- `region` (Required Configuration Block) supports the following:
    - `id` - (Required String) The ID of the Schema Registry region that the Schema Registry cluster belongs to, for example, `sgreg-1`. See [Schema Registry Regions](https://docs.confluent.io/cloud/current/stream-governance/packages.html#stream-governance-regions) to find a corresponding region ID based on desired cloud provider region and types of the billing package.

## Attributes Reference

In addition to the preceding arguments, the following attributes are exported:

- `id` - (Required String) The ID of the Schema Registry cluster, for example, `lsrc-abc123`.
- `api_version` - (Required String) An API Version of the schema version of the Schema Registry cluster, for example, `srcm/v2`.
- `kind` - (Required String) A kind of the Schema Registry cluster, for example, `Cluster`.
- `rest_endpoint` - (Required String) The HTTP endpoint of the Schema Registry cluster, for example, `https://psrc-00000.us-west-2.aws.confluent.cloud`.
- `display_name` - (Required String) The name of the Schema Registry cluster, for example, `Stream Governance Package`.
- `resource_name` - (Required String) The Confluent Resource Name of the Schema Registry cluster, for example, `crn://confluent.cloud/organization=1111aaaa-11aa-11aa-11aa-111111aaaaaa/environment=env-abc123/schema-registry=lsrc-abc123`.

!> **Warning:** Schema Registry clusters can be upgraded from `ESSENTIALS` to `ADVANCED`, but cannot be downgraded from `ADVANCED` to `ESSENTIALS`.

## Import

-> **Note:** `CONFLUENT_CLOUD_API_KEY` and `CONFLUENT_CLOUD_API_SECRET` environment variables must be set before importing a Schema Registry cluster.

You can import a Schema Registry cluster by using Environment ID and Schema Registry cluster ID, in the format `<Environment ID>/<Schema Registry cluster ID>`, for example:

```shell
$ export CONFLUENT_CLOUD_API_KEY="<cloud_api_key>"
$ export CONFLUENT_CLOUD_API_SECRET="<cloud_api_secret>"
$ terraform import confluent_schema_registry_cluster.example env-abc123/lsrc-abc123
```

!> **Warning:** Do not forget to delete terminal command history afterwards for security purposes.
