# confluent_network_link_service Resource

[![General Availability](https://img.shields.io/badge/Lifecycle%20Stage-General%20Availability-%2345c6e8)](https://docs.confluent.io/cloud/current/api.html#section/Versioning/API-Lifecycle-Policy)

`confluent_network_link_service` provides a Network Link Service resource that enables creating, editing, and deleting Network Link Services on Confluent Cloud.

-> **Note:** It is recommended to set `lifecycle { prevent_destroy = true }` on production instances to prevent accidental Network Link Service deletion. This setting rejects plans that would destroy or recreate the Network Link Service, such as attempting to change uneditable attributes. Read more about it in the [Terraform docs](https://www.terraform.io/language/meta-arguments/lifecycle#prevent_destroy).

## Example Usage

### Example Network Link Service on AWS

```terraform
resource "confluent_environment" "development" {
  display_name = "Development"
}

resource "confluent_network" "aws-private-link" {
  display_name     = "AWS Private Link Network"
  cloud            = "AWS"
  region           = "us-east-1"
  connection_types = ["PRIVATELINK"]
  zones            = ["use1-az1", "use1-az2", "use1-az6"]
  environment {
    id = confluent_environment.development.id
  }

  lifecycle {
    prevent_destroy = true
  }
}

resource "confluent_network_link_service" "aws_nls" {
  display_name = "AWS Private Link network link service"
  environment {
    id = confluent_environment.development.id
  }
  network {
    id = confluent_network.aws-private-link.id
  }
  description = "Test NL service"
  accept {
    environments = ["env-5678", "env-0923"]
    networks = ["n-1234"]
  }

  lifecycle {
    prevent_destroy = true
  }
}
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

- `display_name` - (Optional String) The name of the Network Link Service.
- `description` - (Optional String) The description of the Network Link Service.
- `environment` (Required Configuration Block) supports the following:
  - `id` - (Required String) The ID of the Environment that the Network Link Service belongs to, for example, `env-abc123`.
- `network` (Required Configuration Block) supports the following:
  - `id` - (Required String) The ID of the Network that the Network Link Service belongs to, for example, `n-abc123`.
- `accept` (Optional Configuration Block) supports the following:
  - `environments` - (Optional List of Strings) List of environments ids from which connections can be accepted. All networks within the list of environment will be allowed.
  - `networks` - (Optional List of Strings) List of network ids from which connections can be accepted.

## Attributes Reference

In addition to the preceding arguments, the following attributes are exported:

- `id` - (Required String) The ID of the Network Link Service, for example, `nls-abc123`.
- `resource_name` (Required String) The Confluent Resource Name of the Network Link Service.

## Import

-> **Note:** `CONFLUENT_CLOUD_API_KEY` and `CONFLUENT_CLOUD_API_SECRET` environment variables must be set before importing a Network Link Service.

You can import a Network Link Service by using Environment ID and Network Link Service ID, in the format `<Environment ID>/<Network Link Service ID>`. The following example shows how to import a Network Link Service:

```shell
$ export CONFLUENT_CLOUD_API_KEY="<cloud_api_key>"
$ export CONFLUENT_CLOUD_API_SECRET="<cloud_api_secret>"
$ terraform import confluent_network_link_service.my_nls env-abc123/nls-abc123
```
