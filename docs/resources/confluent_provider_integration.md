# confluent_provider_integration Resource

[![General Availability](https://img.shields.io/badge/Lifecycle%20Stage-General%20Availability-%2345c6e8)](https://docs.confluent.io/cloud/current/api.html#section/Versioning/API-Lifecycle-Policy)

`confluent_provider_integration` allows Confluent Cloud integration with a public Cloud Service Provider (CSP) that grants users to manage access to public CSP resources through Confluent resources.

-> **Note:** It is recommended to set `lifecycle { prevent_destroy = true }` on production instances to prevent accidental Provider Integration deletion. This setting rejects plans that would destroy or recreate the Provider Integration, such as attempting to change un-editable attributes. Read more about it in the [Terraform docs](https://www.terraform.io/language/meta-arguments/lifecycle#prevent_destroy).

## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "confluent_environment" "staging" {
  display_name = "Staging"
  
  stream_governance {
    package = "ESSENTIALS"
  }
}

resource "confluent_provider_integration" "main" {
  environment {
    id = confluent_environment.staging.id
  }
  aws {
    customer_role_arn = var.customer_role_arn    #User specific AWS customer IAM role ARN
  }
  display_name = "provider_integration_main"
}
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

- `display_name` - (Required String) The name of the Provider Integration.
- `environment` - (Required Configuration Block) supports the following:
    - `id` - (Required String) The ID of the Environment that the Provider Integration belongs to, for example, `env-abc123`.
- `aws` - (Required Configuration Block) The AWS-specific Provider Integration config details. It supports the following:
    - `customer_role_arn` - (Required String) Amazon Resource Name (ARN) that identifies the AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) role that Confluent Cloud assumes when it accesses resources in your AWS account.

-> **Note:** Currently only `aws` config is supported, more cloud service provider config will be supported in the short future.

-> **Note:** `customer_role_arn` must be unique in a given environment for creating a new Provider Integration.

## Attributes Reference

In addition to the preceding arguments, the following attributes are exported:

- `id` - (Required String) The ID of the Provider Integration, for example, `cspi-4xg0q`.
- `aws` - (Required Configuration Block) The AWS-specific Provider Integration config details. It supports the following:
    - `iam_role_arn` - (Required String) The IAM role ARN used in Confluent Cloud internally, bundled with `customer_role_arn`.
    - `external_id` - (Required String) Unique external ID that Confluent Cloud uses when it assumes the IAM role in your Amazon Web Services (AWS) account.
- `usages` - (Required List of Strings) List of resource CRNs where this provider integration is being used.

## Import

-> **Note:** `CONFLUENT_CLOUD_API_KEY` and `CONFLUENT_CLOUD_API_SECRET` environment variables must be set before importing a Provider Integration.

You can import a Provider Integration by using Environment ID and Provider Integration ID, in the format `<Environment ID>/<Provider Integration ID>`. The following example shows how to import a Provider Integration:

```shell
$ export CONFLUENT_CLOUD_API_KEY="<cloud_api_key>"
$ export CONFLUENT_CLOUD_API_SECRET="<cloud_api_secret>"
$ terraform import confluent_provider_integration.main env-abc123/cspi-4xg0q
```
