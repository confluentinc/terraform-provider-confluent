# confluent_vim_car Resource

[![General Availability](https://img.shields.io/badge/Lifecycle%20Stage-General%20Availability-%2345c6e8)](https://docs.confluent.io/cloud/current/api.html#section/Versioning/API-Lifecycle-Policy)

`confluent_vim_car` provides a Car resource that enables creating, editing, and deleting Cars on Confluent Cloud.

## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "confluent_vim_car" "my_car" {
  manufacturer = "Toyota"
  model        = "Camry"
}

# Output the webhook endpoint
output "car_webhook_endpoint" {
  value       = confluent_vim_car.my_car.webhook_endpoint
  description = "The webhook endpoint for car status updates"
}
```

<!-- schema generated by tfplugindocs -->
## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

- `manufacturer` - (Required String) The manufacturer of the car. This can be updated in-place.
- `model` - (Optional String, Forces new resource) The model name of the car (e.g., 'Camry', 'F-150'). This is immutable and changing it will recreate the resource.

## Attributes Reference

In addition to the preceding arguments, the following attributes are exported:

- `id` - (Required String) The ID of the Car (e.g., `car-abc123`).
- `webhook_endpoint` - (Computed String) A publicly accessible URL where car status updates (e.g., 'maintenance_required', 'low_fuel') will be sent via POST requests. This is automatically generated by the API and cannot be set manually.

## Import

You can import a Car by using Car ID, for example:

```shell
$ export CONFLUENT_CLOUD_API_KEY="<cloud_api_key>"
$ export CONFLUENT_CLOUD_API_SECRET="<cloud_api_secret>"
$ terraform import confluent_vim_car.my_car car-12345
```
