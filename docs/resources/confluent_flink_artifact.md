# confluent_flink_artifact Resource

[![General Availability](https://img.shields.io/badge/Lifecycle%20Stage-General%20Availability-%2345c6e8)](https://docs.confluent.io/cloud/current/api.html#section/Versioning/API-Lifecycle-Policy)

`confluent_flink_artifact` provides a Flink Artifact resource that enables creating and deleting Flink Artifact on Confluent Cloud.

-> **Note:** It is recommended to set `lifecycle { prevent_destroy = true }` on production instances to prevent accidental Flink Artifact deletion. This setting rejects plans that would destroy or recreate the Flink Artifact, such as attempting to change uneditable attributes. Read more about it in the [Terraform docs](https://www.terraform.io/language/meta-arguments/lifecycle#prevent_destroy).

## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "confluent_environment" "development" {
  display_name = "Development"
}

resource "confluent_flink_artifact" "main" {
  class          = "io.confluent.example.SumScalarFunction"
  region         = "us-west-2"
  cloud          = "AWS"
  display_name   = "flink_sumscalar_artifact"
  content_format = "JAR"
  environment {
    id = confluent_environment.development.id
  }
}
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

- `display_name` - (Required String) The display name of Flink Artifact.
- `cloud` - (Required String) The cloud service provider that runs the Flink Artifact.
- `region` - (Required String) The cloud service provider region that hosts the Flink Artifact.
- `class` - (Required String) Java class or alias for the Flink Artifact as provided by developer.
- `artifact_file` - (Required String) The artifact file for Flink Artifact.
- `environment` (Required Configuration Block) supports the following:
    - `id` - (Required String) The ID of the Environment that the Flink Artifact Pool belongs to, for example, `env-abc123`.

## Attributes Reference

In addition to the preceding arguments, the following attributes are exported:

- `id` - (Required String) The ID of the Flink Artifact, for example, `lfa-abc123`.
- `content_format` - (Optional String) Archive format of the Flink Artifact.
- `runtime_language` - (Optional String) Runtime language of the Flink Artifact. The default runtime language is Java.
- `description` - (Optional String) Description of the Flink Artifact.
- `api_version` - (Required String) The API Version of the schema version of the Flink Artifact Pool, for example, `fa/v2`.
- `kind` - (Required String) The kind of the Flink Artifact Pool, for example, `FlinkArtifact`.

## Import

-> **Note:** Set `artifact_file = ""` or use `IMPORT_ARTIFACT_FILENAME` environment variables before importing a Flink Artifact.

-> **Note:** `CONFLUENT_CLOUD_API_KEY` and `CONFLUENT_CLOUD_API_SECRET` environment variables must be set before importing a Flink Artifact.

You can import a Flink Artifact by using cloud, region, Flink Artifact ID and artifact file, in the format `<Environment ID>/<region>/<cloud>/<Flink Artifact ID>`. The following example shows how to import a Flink Artifact:

```shell
$ export CONFLUENT_CLOUD_API_KEY="<cloud_api_key>"
$ export CONFLUENT_CLOUD_API_SECRET="<cloud_api_secret>"
$ terraform import confluent_flink_artifact.main env-abc123/us-east-1/aws/fa-123
```
