# confluent_connect_artifact Resource

[![General Availability](https://img.shields.io/badge/Lifecycle%20Stage-General%20Availability-%2345c6e8)](https://docs.confluent.io/cloud/current/api.html#section/Versioning/API-Lifecycle-Policy)

`confluent_connect_artifact` provides a Connect Artifact resource that enables creating and deleting Connect Artifact on Confluent Cloud.

-> **Note:** It is recommended to set `lifecycle { prevent_destroy = true }` on production instances to prevent accidental Connect Artifact deletion. This setting rejects plans that would destroy or recreate the Connect Artifact, such as attempting to change uneditable attributes. Read more about it in the [Terraform docs](https://www.terraform.io/language/meta-arguments/lifecycle#prevent_destroy).

## Example Usage

```hcl
resource "confluent_connect_artifact" "example" {
  display_name = "example-connect-artifact"
  cloud        = "AWS"
  region       = "us-west-2"
  environment {
    id = "env-123456"
  }
  content_format = "JAR"
  artifact_file  = "my_connect_artifact.jar"
  description    = "Example Connect Artifact"
}
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `display_name` - (Required String) The unique name of the Connect Artifact per cloud, region, environment scope.
* `cloud` - (Required String) Cloud provider where the Connect Artifact archive is uploaded.
* `region` - (Required String) The Cloud provider region the Connect Artifact archive is uploaded.
* `environment` - (Required Block) The Environment that the Connect Artifact belongs to, for example, `env-abc123`. It supports the following:
* `id` - (Required String) The ID of the Environment that the Connect Artifact belongs to.

## Attributes Reference

In addition to the arguments listed above, the following computed attributes are exported:

* `id` - (String) The ID of the Connect Artifact.

## Import

-> **Note:** Set `artifact_file = ""` or use `IMPORT_ARTIFACT_FILENAME` environment variables before importing a Connect Artifact.

-> **Note:** `CONFLUENT_CLOUD_API_KEY` and `CONFLUENT_CLOUD_API_SECRET` environment variables must be set before importing a Connect Artifact.

You can import a Connect Artifact by using Environment ID, Region, Cloud, and Connect Artifact ID in the format `<Environment ID>/<region>/<cloud>/<Connect Artifact ID>`, for example:

```shell
$ export CONFLUENT_CLOUD_API_KEY="<cloud_api_key>"
$ export CONFLUENT_CLOUD_API_SECRET="<cloud_api_secret>"
$ terraform import confluent_connect_artifact.example env-123456/us-west-2/AWS/ca-123456
```
