# confluent_network_link_endpoint Resource

[![Early Access](https://img.shields.io/badge/Lifecycle%20Stage-Early%20Access-%2300afba)](https://docs.confluent.io/cloud/current/api.html#section/Versioning/API-Lifecycle-Policy)

-> **Note:** `confluent_network_link_endpoint` resource is available in **Early Access** for early adopters. Early Access features are introduced to gather customer feedback. This feature should be used only for evaluation and non-production testing purposes or to provide feedback to Confluent, particularly as it becomes more widely available in follow-on editions.  
**Early Access** features are intended for evaluation use in development and testing environments only, and not for production use. The warranty, SLA, and Support Services provisions of your agreement with Confluent do not apply to Early Access features. Early Access features are considered to be a Proof of Concept as defined in the Confluent Cloud Terms of Service. Confluent may discontinue providing Early Access releases of the Early Access features at any time in Confluent’s sole discretion.

`confluent_network_link_endpoint` provides a Network Link Endpoint resource that enables creating, editing, and deleting Network Link Endpoints on Confluent Cloud.

-> **Note:** It is recommended to set `lifecycle { prevent_destroy = true }` on production instances to prevent accidental Network Link Endpoint deletion. This setting rejects plans that would destroy or recreate the Network Link Endpoint, such as attempting to change uneditable attributes. Read more about it in the [Terraform docs](https://www.terraform.io/language/meta-arguments/lifecycle#prevent_destroy).

## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "confluent_network_link_endpoint" "nle" {
  display_name = "nle1"
  description  = "TEST-NLE1"
  environment {
    id = "env-xyz456"
  }
  network {
    id = "n-abc123"
  }
  network_link_service {
    id = "nls-g3e1ox"
  }
}

output "network_link_endpoint" {
  value = confluent_network_link_endpoint.nle
}
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

- `display_name` - (Optional String) The name of the Network Link Endpoint.
- `description` - (Optional String) The description of the Network Link Endpoint.
- `network` (Required Configuration Block) supports the following:
  - `id` - (Required String) The ID of the Network that the Network Link Endpoint belongs to, for example, `n-abc123`.
- `network_link_service` (Required Configuration Block) supports the following:
  - `id` - (Required String) The ID of the Network Link Service, for example, `nls-g3e1ox`.
- `environment` (Required Configuration Block) supports the following:
  - `id` - (Required String) The ID of the Environment that the Network Link Endpoint belongs to, for example, `env-xyz456`.

## Attributes Reference

In addition to the preceding arguments, the following attributes are exported:

- `id` - (Required String) The ID of the Network Link Endpoint, for example, `nle-abc123`.
- `resource_name` (Required String) The Confluent Resource Name of the Network Link Endpoint.

## Import

-> **Note:** `CONFLUENT_CLOUD_API_KEY` and `CONFLUENT_CLOUD_API_SECRET` environment variables must be set before importing a Network Link Endpoint.

You can import a Network Link Endpoint by using Environment ID and Network Link Endpoint ID, in the format `<Environment ID>/<Network Link Endpoint ID>`. The following example shows how to import a Network Link Endpoint:

```shell
$ export CONFLUENT_CLOUD_API_KEY="<cloud_api_key>"
$ export CONFLUENT_CLOUD_API_SECRET="<cloud_api_secret>"
$ terraform import confluent_network_link_endpoint.my_nle env-abc123/nle-abc123
```

!> **Warning:** Do not forget to delete terminal command history afterwards for security purposes.
