[![General Availability](https://img.shields.io/badge/Lifecycle%20Stage-General%20Availability-%2345c6e8)](https://docs.confluent.io/cloud/current/api.html#section/Versioning/API-Lifecycle-Policy)

`confluent_access_point` provides a Access Point resource that enables creating, editing, and deleting Access Points on Confluent Cloud.

## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "confluent_environment" "development" {
  display_name = "Development"
}

resource "confluent_access_point" "aws" {
  display_name = "access_point"
  environment {
    id = confluent_environment.development.id
  }
  gateway {
    id = confluent_network.main.gateway[0].id
  }
  aws_egress_private_link_endpoint {
    vpc_endpoint_service_name = "com.amazonaws.vpce.us-west-2.vpce-svc-00000000000000000"
  }
}

resource "confluent_access_point" "azure" {
  display_name = "access_point"
  environment {
    id = confluent_environment.development.id
  }
  gateway {
    id = confluent_network.main.gateway[0].id
  }
  azure_egress_private_link_endpoint {
    private_link_service_resource_id = "/subscriptions/00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000/resourceGroups/s-abcde/providers/Microsoft.Network/privateLinkServices/pls-plt-abcdef-az3"
    private_link_subresource_name = "sqlServer"
  }
}

resource "confluent_access_point" "gcp" {
  display_name = "access_point"
  environment {
    id = confluent_environment.development.id
  }
  gateway {
    id = confluent_network.main.gateway[0].id
  }
  gcp_egress_private_service_connect_endpoint {
    private_service_connect_endpoint_target = "projects/example-project/regions/us-central1/serviceAttachments/my-service-attachment"
  }
}
```

## Import

-> **Note:** `CONFLUENT_CLOUD_API_KEY` and `CONFLUENT_CLOUD_API_SECRET` environment variables must be set before importing a Access Point.

You can import a Access Point by using Environment ID and Access Point ID, in the format `<Environment ID>/<Access Point ID>`. The following example shows how to import a Access Point:

```shell
$ export CONFLUENT_CLOUD_API_KEY="<cloud_api_key>"
$ export CONFLUENT_CLOUD_API_SECRET="<cloud_api_secret>"
$ terraform import confluent_access_point.main env-abc123/ap-abc123
```

!> **Warning:** Do not forget to delete terminal command history afterwards for security purposes.
