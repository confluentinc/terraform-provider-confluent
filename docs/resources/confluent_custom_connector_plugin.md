# confluent_custom_connector_plugin Resource

[![General Availability](https://img.shields.io/badge/Lifecycle%20Stage-General%20Availability-%2345c6e8)](https://docs.confluent.io/cloud/current/api.html#section/Versioning/API-Lifecycle-Policy)

`confluent_custom_connector_plugin` provides a Custom Connector Plugin resource that enables creating, editing, and deleting Custom Connector Plugins on Confluent Cloud.

-> **Note:** See [Custom Connector Quick Start](https://docs.confluent.io/cloud/current/connectors/bring-your-connector/custom-connector-qs.html#custom-connector-quick-start) and [Custom Connector Plugin Examples](https://docs.confluent.io/cloud/current/connectors/connect-api-section.html#custom-connector-plugin-examples) for more details.

-> **Note:** It is recommended to set `lifecycle { prevent_destroy = true }` on production instances to prevent accidental Custom Connector Plugin deletion. This setting rejects plans that would destroy or recreate the Custom Connector Plugin, such as attempting to change uneditable attributes. Read more about it in the [Terraform docs](https://www.terraform.io/language/meta-arguments/lifecycle#prevent_destroy).

## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "confluent_custom_connector_plugin" "source" {
  # https://docs.confluent.io/cloud/current/connectors/bring-your-connector/custom-connector-qs.html#custom-connector-quick-start
  display_name                = "Datagen Source Connector Plugin"
  documentation_link          = "https://www.confluent.io/hub/confluentinc/kafka-connect-datagen"
  connector_class             = "io.confluent.kafka.connect.datagen.DatagenConnector"
  connector_type              = "SOURCE"
  sensitive_config_properties = []
  filename                    = "confluentinc-kafka-connect-datagen-0.6.2.zip"
}
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

- `display_name` - (Required String) The name of the Custom Connector Plugin.
- `description` - (Optional String) The description of the Custom Connector Plugin.
- `documentation_link` - (Optional String) The documentation link of the Custom Connector Plugin.
- `connector_class` - (Required String) The Java class or alias for the connector. You can get the connector class from the connector documentation provided by the developer.
- `connector_type` - (Required String) The type of the Custom Connector Plugin. Accepted values are: `SOURCE`, `SINK`.
- `sensitive_config_properties` - (Optional List of Strings) The list of sensitive properties. A sensitive property is a connector configuration property that must be hidden after a user enters the property value when setting up the connector, for example, passwords, keys, and tokens. Refer to the developer documentation and add all required and optional sensitive properties that a user could potentially configure for the connector. Marking a property as sensitive ensures that these fields are handled appropriately within the Confluent infrastructure. This includes masking fields, for example in exception logging, and encrypting field values in the underlying data store. You must identify all sensitive properties. Failure to identify sensitive properties can result in the sensitive property value being stored in plain text rather than in encrypted format. Only add connector-specific sensitive properties. Kafka keys, passwords, and service account information should not be entered here.
- `filename` - (Required String) The path to the Custom Connector Plugin archive to be uploaded. Accepted archive formats are: `.jar`, `.zip`.

## Attributes Reference

In addition to the preceding arguments, the following attributes are exported:

- `id` - (Required String) The ID of the Custom Connector Plugin, for example, `ccp-abc123xyz`.

## Import

-> **Note:** Set `filename = ""` or use `IMPORT_CUSTOM_CONNECTOR_PLUGIN_FILENAME` environment variables before importing a Custom Connector Plugin.

-> **Note:** `CONFLUENT_CLOUD_API_KEY` and `CONFLUENT_CLOUD_API_SECRET` environment variables must be set before importing a Custom Connector Plugin.

You can import a Custom Connector Plugin by using a Custom Connector Plugin ID, in the format `<Custom Connector Plugin>`. The following example shows how to import a Custom Connector Plugin:

```shell
$ export CONFLUENT_CLOUD_API_KEY="<cloud_api_key>"
$ export CONFLUENT_CLOUD_API_SECRET="<cloud_api_secret>"
$ terraform import confluent_custom_connector_plugin.main ccp-abc123xyz
```

!> **Warning:** Do not forget to delete terminal command history afterwards for security purposes.
