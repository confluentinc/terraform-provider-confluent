### Notes

1. Make sure to create a Flink table called `customers_source` before running this example.
    ```bash
    CREATE TABLE customers_source (
        customer_id INT,
        name STRING,
        address STRING,
        postcode STRING,
        city STRING,
        email STRING,
        PRIMARY KEY (customer_id) NOT ENFORCED
    );
   ```
2. Then run the following 2 statements:
    ```bash
    INSERT INTO customers_source (
        customer_id,
        name,
        address,
        postcode,
        city,
        email
    )
    SELECT
        customer_id,
        name,  
        address,
        postcode,
        city,
        email
    FROM examples.marketplace.customers;
    ```
    ```bash
    CREATE TABLE customers_sink (
        customer_id INT,
        name STRING,
        address STRING,
        postcode STRING,
        city STRING,
        email STRING,
        PRIMARY KEY (customer_id) NOT ENFORCED
    );
    ```
3. Apply this Terraform configuration by following the [Sample Project for Confluent Terraform Provider](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/confluentinc/confluent/latest/docs/guides/sample-project).
4. Stop `confluent_flink_statement.old` by setting `stopped = true` and running `terraform apply`. 
5. Uncomment `confluent_flink_statement.new` and run `terraform apply` to create a new statement with carried over offsets.
6. In Confluent Cloud for Apache FlinkÂ®, an environment is mapped to a Flink catalog, a Kafka cluster is mapped to a Flink database, and a Kafka topic is mapped to a Flink table.
7. See [Sample Project for Confluent Terraform Provider](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/confluentinc/confluent/latest/docs/guides/sample-project) that provides step-by-step instructions of running this example.
