### Notes

1. See [Sample Project for Confluent Terraform Provider](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/confluentinc/confluent/latest/docs/guides/sample-project) that provides step-by-step instructions of running this example.

2. This example assumes that Terraform is run from a host in the private network (you could also leverage the ["Agent" Execution Mode](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/cloud-docs/agents) if you are using Terraform Enterprise), where it will have connectivity to the [Kafka REST API](https://docs.confluent.io/cloud/current/api.html#tag/Topic-(v3)) in other words, to the [REST endpoint](https://docs.confluent.io/cloud/current/clusters/broker-config.html#access-cluster-settings-in-the-ccloud-console) on the provisioned Kafka cluster. If it is not, you must make these changes:


    * Update the `confluent_api_key` resources by setting their `disable_wait_for_ready` flag to `true`. Otherwise, Terraform will attempt to validate API key creation by listing topics, which will fail without access to the Kafka REST API. Otherwise, you might see errors like:

        ```
        Error: error waiting for Kafka API Key "[REDACTED]" to sync: error listing Kafka Topics using Kafka API Key "[REDACTED]": Get "[https://[REDACTED]/kafka/v3/clusters/[REDACTED]/topics](https://[REDACTED]/kafka/v3/clusters/[REDACTED]/topics)": GET [https://[REDACTED]/kafka/v3/clusters/[REDACTED]/topics](https://[REDACTED]/kafka/v3/clusters/[REDACTED]/topics) giving up after 5 attempt(s): Get "[https://[REDACTED]/kafka/v3/clusters/[REDACTED]/topics](https://[REDACTED]/kafka/v3/clusters/[REDACTED/topics)": dial tcp [REDACTED]:443: i/o timeout
        ```

    * Remove the `confluent_kafka_topic` resource. These resources are provisioned using the Kafka REST API, which is only accessible from the private network.

3. If you run into

    ```
    Error: Invalid function argument
    
      on main.tf line 249, in locals:
     249:   ]) > 0 ? file("\n\nerror: private link endpoint network policies must be disabled https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/private-link/disable-private-endpoint-network-policy") : ""
    
    Invalid value for "path" parameter: no file exists at
    
    error: private link endpoint network policies must be disabled
    https:/docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/private-link/disable-private-endpoint-network-policy;
    this function works only with files that are distributed as part of the
    configuration source code, so if this file will be created by a resource in
    this configuration you must instead obtain this result from an attribute of
    that resource.
    ```

    You may need to run the following command:

    ```
    az network vnet subnet update \
      --disable-private-endpoint-network-policies true \
      --name default \
      --resource-group myResourceGroup \
      --vnet-name myVirtualNetwork
    ```
    For more information, see [Disable network policy](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/private-link/disable-private-endpoint-network-policy).

4. One common deployment workflow for environments with private networking is as follows:

    * A initial (centrally-run) Terraform deployment provisions infrastructure: network, Kafka cluster, and other resources on cloud provider of your choice to setup private network connectivity (like DNS records)

    * A secondary Terraform deployment (run from within the private network) provisions data-plane resources (Kafka Topics and ACLs)

    * Note that RBAC role bindings can be provisioned in either the first or second step, as they are provisioned through the [Confluent Cloud API](https://docs.confluent.io/cloud/current/api.html), not the [Kafka REST API](https://docs.confluent.io/cloud/current/api.html#tag/Topic-(v3))
