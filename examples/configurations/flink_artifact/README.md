### Notes

1. In Confluent Cloud for Apache FlinkÂ®, an environment is mapped to a Flink catalog, a Kafka cluster is mapped to a Flink database, and a Kafka topic is mapped to a Flink table.
2. See [Create a User Defined Function for Flink SQL](https://docs.confluent.io/cloud/current/flink/how-to-guides/create-udf.html) that provides step-by-step instructions of running this example.
3. Follow step 1 of the guide above to build the Uber JAR ("flink_artifact.jar"), and then run `terraform plan` as usual to mirror steps 2 and 3 of [Create a User Defined Function for Flink SQL](https://docs.confluent.io/cloud/current/flink/how-to-guides/create-udf.html).
